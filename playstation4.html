        <p>The Playstation 4 and its contoller has been around since 2013. My
           experience with the ps4 controller has been amazing. I love how it
           has a mic plugin at the bottom and a charger plugin at the top. This
           conroller has a wide range of colour and creativity with the use of
           the shapes "X (blue), Square (pink), O (red) and Triangle (green)."
           Unlike the Xbox contoller the Playstation 4 contolller has its
           2 clickable joysicks side by side for easy use and the D-pad
           (directional pad) located on the left side of the contoller with the
           touchpad situated right in the middle of the contoller with the ps
           button (home button) underneath it. On each top corner of the
           controller there is 2 buttons L2 and L1 for the left side and R1 and
           R2 for the right side. There are 2 more buttons the "Options" and
           "Share" buttons allow you to take a screenshot or video or access in
           game options. You are also given the option for wired or wireless
           with wired being an extra cord that can charge the contoller while
           still being used.</p>
