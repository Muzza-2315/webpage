        <p>This controller was one of xbox's first being made in  late 2005.
           Being the competitor of the Playstation contoller there are a lot of
           similarities and differences between them with the similarities being
           that it has a D-pad (directional pad), 2 clickable joysicks, 2
           buttons at the top corner of each side, 4 buttons located on the
           right side of the controller but its "A (green), B (red), X (blue), Y
           (yellow)" for the xbox controller. There are 3 more buttons: The xbox
           button (home button) and the 2 other buttons that have the names
           "Back" and "Start".</p>
