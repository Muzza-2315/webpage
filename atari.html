        <p>The Atari CX10 Joystick was released in 1977 with a really simple
          structure. It had one button with an 8-directional joystick which was
          one of the first widely used game controller in the world. Being one
          of the first game controllers, its amazing to see how far game
          controllers have come since this was made.</p>
