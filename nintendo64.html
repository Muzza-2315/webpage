        <p>The controller of the Nintendo 64 was made in 1996 and it has a very
          simple design of a D-pad (directional pad) located on the left of the contoller, a red
          button and joystick with the classic nintendo logo in the middle and
          red and green buttons located underneath 4 yellow buttons on the right
          side of the contoller. It also has three triggers and an expansion
          port on the back. The origanal controller is wired but options that
          are wireless are going to be added in the near-future.</p>
